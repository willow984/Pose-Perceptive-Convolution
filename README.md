# Pose-Perceptive-Convolution
Our research paper, "Pose-Perceptive Convolution: Learning Geometry-Adaptive Receptive Fields for Robust 6D Pose Estimation" was submitted for review on November 10th. 

The official code repository has been created, and we are actively preparing and uploading the source code, pre-trained models, and experimental configurations.

The full content will be made available here soon. Thank you for your interest!
